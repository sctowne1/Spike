 This is an image editing program that implements image editing functions from the following packages:
   PIL
   skikit-image
   scipy
   numpy

 It also utilizes pyqt5 for creation of the GUI.

 The following functions have been implemented:
   Load Image, Save Image, Mirror Image, Invert Image, Rotate Image, Grayscale Image, Compare and Undo.

 This program supports .jpg and .png files; HOWEVER, when editing a .png file the image that appears in the Spike display
 appears to lose quality, though if you open the edited image outside of the program after saving it, no quality has 
 actually been lost.
